This could indicate a leak, so it’s wise to check for a leak while you’re under there – but if everything looks as it should, and the light switches off after topping up your engine coolant, you should be able to continue your journey.-->

If it is solid and the car will not start, then the immobilization system has activated due to a security threat or malfunction.
